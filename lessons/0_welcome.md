Welcome to React Native Workshop! Organized by [Tiigsi Workshops](https://tiigsi.org)ðŸ‘‹

## Course Objective

The aim of the course is to give you the knowledge and resources necessary to start building your own React Native project. We will cover what React Native is, how it works, what kind of components and tooling are available, and how to use them. We will stick with built-in and mainstream components, and minimize the use of third party components and libraries.

## Intended audience

The intended audience for this course are people who are familiar with `JavaScript`, but new to React Native. If you already know `React`, that's perfect, since your React skills are completely transferrable to React Native with only minor modifications to account for the native platform.

However if you are new to both React and Native, That is Ok too! We will be explaining all the React concepts as well as the React Native concepts as we discover them together, however there will be more of a focus on the parts of React Native that _differ_ from React on the web.

In this course, I will be using a Windows 11 Laptop, an Andriod Phone or an Android emulator from Android Studio.

You can use

- either a Mac, Windows or Linux machine
- either a physical device (iPhone or Android) OR a simulator/emulator installed

There are a few different ways to start React Native Development

- [React Native CLi](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- [Expo CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Please refer to the official documenations for step by step instructions.
